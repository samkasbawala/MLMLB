# MLMLB
Welcome to the *MLMLB* repo. This project serves as a "do-over" or "revamp" to my senior
year project. *MLMLB* stands for Machine Learning (on) Major League Baseball. The goal
of this project is to try and come up with machine learning and deep learning models to
try and predict the outcomes of baseball games.

## How does this differ from your previous project?
Well in essence, it doesn't really. The project's goal is the same. However, this repo
will be updated and worked on much more regularly as I am the only one who will be
working on this project. The previous project was a senior year capstone project which
is no longer going to be updated. This project seeks to improve upon what was learned
in last year's project.

## Installation
This project uses Python 3.8.11. At the time of writing, the most recent version of
Python is version 3.9.6. I decided to use 3.8 for compatibility reasons with some
packages. I recommend using a virtual environment if you want to fork this repo and work
on it yourself. Here is a [link](https://docs.python.org/3.8/tutorial/venv.html) to
Python's official documentation on virtual environments. Once the appropriate version of
Python and pip are installed and you are in your virtual environment, run
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
which will install all of the required packages needed to run the Jupyter notebook
files.

## Credits
I want to give a huge thanks to the people over at [Retrosheet](https://www.retrosheet.org/).
Their amazing set of volunteers have curated an almost complete set of baseball statistics
for each game. Without their incredible work, this project would have been impossible.
